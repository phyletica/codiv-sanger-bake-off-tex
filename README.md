This repository contains all of the LaTeX files associated with the 
project by the
[Phyletica Lab](http://phyletica.org)
where we
[compared the performance of comparative phylogeographic methods on Sanger sequence datasets](http://phyletica.org/codiv-sanger-bake-off).

Here are the links to the main project:

-   Project site: <http://phyletica.org/codiv-sanger-bake-off/>
-   Project GitHub page: <https://github.com/phyletica/codiv-sanger-bake-off>

We are keeping the LaTeX files separate in this repo to make working on them
via Overleaf easier.
