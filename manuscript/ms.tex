            \Ecoevolity estimates the partitioning of population pairs to
            divergence times (the divergence model) more accurately and
            precisely than \dppmsbayes across all simulated numbers of loci
            (columns) and whether the divergence model was drawn from a
            Dirichlet process (top row), or constrained so that all pairs of
            populations diverged independently (middle row) or simultaneously
            (bottom row).
            Divergence model estimation error was quantified for each
            simulation replicate using the mean partition distance
            \citep{Regnier1983,Gusfield2002} between the true divergence model
            and the posterior samples of divergence models.
            Partition distances was calculated using the Hungarian (or
            Kuhn-Munkres) algorithm
            \citep{Kuhn1955,Munkres1957}
            as implemented in \pycoevolity
            \citep[Version 0.2.11 Commit 85ea44b;][]{Oaks2018ecoevolity,PycoevolityRepoOnline},
            which relies on the Munkres Python package
            \citep[Version 1.1.4;][]{Clapper2020}.
            For each violin plot, the sample size (number of simulation
            replicates) is shown beneath and the mean is represented by the
            white dot and shown above.
            The box shows the upper and lower quartiles and the brackets
            show the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.
            At the top center of each plot, the results of a Mann-Whitney U
            test \citep{MannWhitney1947} are shown comparing mean model errors
            between \ecoevolity and \dppmsbayes;

            \Ecoevolity better estimates divergence times than \dppmsbayes
            across all simulated numbers of loci (columns) and whether the

            constrained so that all pairs of populations diverged independently
            (middle row) or simultaneously (bottom row).
            Divergence time error was quantified for each simulation replicate
            as the sum of the difference between the true and posterior mean
            divergence time across the five pairs of populations.
